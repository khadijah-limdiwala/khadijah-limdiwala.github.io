      "</b>Product Design</b><br> Process + Methodology followed: Inspired by the terracotta clay roof tile, we have conceptualized and illustrated several interior goods with a focus on the circular economy. Working around the fact that we did not have the kiln to bake the terracotta consequently, we made our products using terracotta air clay instead. The clay must first be softened before it can be molded or shaped into the appropriate shapes and forms. We had to work rapidly with the material because it tends to dry up quickly, which was a challenge. We had to make prototypes after our first attempt, which did not turn out as well since we were still getting familiar with the material and learning how to handle it appropriately<br> <br> Applying the learnings from the prototypes, we were able to use then apply the correct treatments to the clay that ensured a much-refined finish in the final items, which is why all of our various products turned out well. We further experimented with various finishes after the products had cured to illustrate their intended usage in reality. After sanding and polishing the products, we painted a couple and applied a nontoxic resin glaze to a few more in order to achieve a polished appearance and a durable product.<br>",
